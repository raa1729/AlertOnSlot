# AlertOnSlot
Chrome Extension for Alerting Users by Paying sound when costco slot is available

This script can refresh the page that you opened and keep on refreshing that page at given interval and alert you by playing a sound when it finds(or on not finding) a particular string.

Right now it is built and tested for https://sameday.costco.com/store/account/orders with String "Right now, all shoppers are busy".

You can update the alert sound by replacing ring.mp3 to whatever you like
Update contentscript.js with what ever text that you don't want to find like "Busy", "Not available" kind of messages
